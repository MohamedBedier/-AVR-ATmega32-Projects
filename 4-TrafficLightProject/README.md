## Traffic Light Project using SSD ,and Three leds(Green,Yello,Red) with Atemga32:

## *********  Overview  *********  
This project simulates a traffic light system using:
 1- Three LEDs: Green, Yellow, and Red.
 2- Seven-Segment Display (SSD) to show countdown timing.
 3- ATmega32 Microcontroller.



## *********  features  ********* 
Simulates a real-world traffic light sequence:
 1- Green light → vehicle pass.
 2- Yellow light → warning/transition.
 3- Red light → stop.
 4- Seven-Segment Display shows remaining time for each light.
 
 
## *********  How It Works  *********  
1- Initialization – All required I/O pins are configured as outputs.

2-Traffic Light Cycle – The LEDs switch in the sequence:
  - *Red → Yellow → Green

3- Timing Display – SSD shows countdown for each light stage.
	
4- Loop – The cycle repeats infinitely..
