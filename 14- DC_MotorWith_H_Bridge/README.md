## Control on DC Motor By H_Bridge using Atemga32 ðŸš—âš¡:

## *********  Overview  *********  

 - This project demonstrates controlling the speed and direction of a DC motor 
using an H-Bridge circuit driven by the ATmega32 microcontroller.
The system can rotate the motor Clockwise,counter clockwise,and stop as needed.
